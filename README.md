# SQLdataExploration
Exploring various insights from Our World In Data Covid-19 Dataset. Imported the dataset in MS SQL Server and ran queries to undercover various insights in the data.

## Tools Used
Excel, MS SQL Server

## Dataset
Dataset Can Be Downloaded From : https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

## Tutorial
I did this project from a yotube video made by Alex The Analyst Youtube Channel. The url of the video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst

## What did I actually do in this project ?

1. Downloaded the dataset from the link above.
2. Made two excel workbooks from a single csv file that was downloaded in step 1.
3. Created a Database in MS SQL Server.
4. Imported the two excel workbooks into the MS SQL server.
5. Performed queries to find different insights from the data. ( I have also performed my own queries along with the queries done by Alex in the video tutorial.)
6. Finally uploading the SQL queries on Github.

## What did I Learn ?

This is a beginner level project. And as a beginner, it gave me more clarity in performing SQL queries. Here are the points below that I learnt from this project :

1. How to import excel workbooks in MS SQL Server.
2. Null value is eliminated by an aggregate function or other set operator while performing operation.
3. Cast() & Convert() function in SQL Server.
4. Use Of CTE.
5. Order by 1,2 or Order by 3,4 meaning
6. sum(max()) is not possible.
